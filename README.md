# MATLAB-AudioAnalysis

The intial idea of this small project was to animate a 3D spectrogram while writing in the
original audio, keeping in time. The result is two MATLAB functions, one used for the analysis 
and visualisation of the audio and another for the live microphone recording input. 

The code could be expanded with further analysis features. It could also be further optimised.

This function processes audio performing analysis functions then
provides the user with an animated 3D Spectrogram of the audio, a simple
yet interesting way to visualise audio data. The function includes a
small feature to dynamically determine the input command used. This 
function processes both single and dual channel audio.

All output files are saved as either .wav or .avi format.

Input either an audio file of any type from the same folder or simply
type 'record' to be given the option of analysing data from a live
microphone feed.
